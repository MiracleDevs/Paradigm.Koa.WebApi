# Paradigm.Koa.WebApi

A port of Paradigm.Express.WebApi to use koa as the internal server and router. The objective is still provide a clear architecture and patterns to work on webapis, allowing async methods, clear server-agnostic interfaces for controller and services, and include filters, which not only include the http context, but the routing context, with metadata about controllers and actions.
